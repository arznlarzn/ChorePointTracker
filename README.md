# ChorePointTracker
 A point tracker for paired participants from when I worked in a homeless shelter that catered to couples, partners, or just pairs of people. Beds went from 1 - 76, and each bed had 2 people.  I kept track of each bed with an 'A' or 'B' to represent each of the people. Data was saved by creating a text file with the information and I added functionality for users to be able to export to a text file for their viewing as well.

 Because I uploaded the entire program at once and not through 'push' updates, the only 'changes' I recently made, were adding comments to breakdown each section of the code.
