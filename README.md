# ChorePointTracker
 A point tracker for paired participants from when I worked in a homeless shelter that catered to couples, partners, or just pairs of people. Beds went from 1 - 76, and each bed had 2 people.  I kept track of each bed with an 'A' or 'B' to represent each of the people. Data was saved by creating a text file with the information and I added functionality for users to be able to export to a text file for their viewing as well.

 Because I uploaded the entire program at once and not through 'push' updates, the only 'changes' I recently made, were adding comments to breakdown each section of the code.

 Clarification on the last update called "Create bunk_points.txt" push- At no point does the user need to create this file, nor do they ever need to access it. This file is created and formatted automatically when using the application. Being able to access the file and it's format is to save the points and for the user to be able to view all chore points per person, at a glance.
